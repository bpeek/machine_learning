## Ch 2 Answers

These are my answers to the end of chapter computer exercise C2 in Chapter 2 of Introductory Econometrics 5e by Jeffrey Wooldridge.

###C2

###i)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(data$salary)
mean(data$ceoten)
```

###ii)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(data$ceoten == 0)
max(data$ceoten)
```
There are 5 CEOs in their first year and the longest tenure for a CEO in the dataset is 37 years.

###iii)
```{r, echo=TRUE}
log.salary.model <- lm(log(salary) ~ ceoten, data = data)
summary(log.salary.model)
```
The log salary of a CEO is expected to increase by about 1% for every year of experience they have as CEO.
